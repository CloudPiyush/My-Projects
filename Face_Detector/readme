# Real-Time Face Detection App

Welcome to the Real-Time Face Detection App! This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures video feed from the webcam and processes it in real-time.
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Highlights detected faces with colorful rectangles.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CloudPiyush/My-Projects/tree/local/Face_Detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Download Haar Cascade File**:
   Download the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file from [OpenCV's GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

2. **How It Works**:
   - The app captures video from the webcam.
   - Converts each frame to grayscale for faster processing.
   - Detects faces and draws rectangles around them with random colors.

## Code Overview

Here's a brief overview of the main script:

```python
import cv2
from random import randrange

# Load pre-trained face data
Trained_Face_Data = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Capture video from webcam
Web_Cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    Frame_red, Frame = Web_Cam.read()
    Grayscaled_Image = cv2.cvtColor(Frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    Detect_Face = Trained_Face_Data.detectMultiScale(Grayscaled_Image)

    for (X, Y, W, H) in Detect_Face:
        cv2.rectangle(Frame, (X, Y), (X + W, Y + H), (randrange(256), randrange(256), randrange(256)), 4)

    cv2.imshow('Real-Time Face Detector', Frame)
    cv2.waitKey(1)
```
